## Glam Up My Markup: Solar System

### Use CSS and JavaScript to make the  starter HTML markup for the Solar System visually stunning, interactive, and educational. We've provided a basic template that lists planets, moons, and other celestial objects in our Solar System, along with some facts about each. Since the template doesn't include any design elements or interactivity, youâ€™ll need to get creative to make it visually appealing and engaging. Your submission should enhance the user experience with a fun, dynamic design, but must also be accessible and easy to use. You should avoid directly modifying the HTML itself, unless it is through JavaScript. Your final submission should balance style and substance. You may add basic boilerplate code, such as meta tags and structure, to ensure proper presentation and functionality.
